# Multimodal scene reorganization for audio Categorization

## INTRODUCTION

Modality is basically the way in which something happens or is experienced and a research problem is said to be multimodal when it includes such multiple modalities.  To make Artificial Intelligence progressive in understanding the world around us, it needs to be able to interpret such multimodal signals together. Multimodal machine learning aims to build models that can process and relate information from multiple modalities. 
It is a vibrant multi-disciplinary field of increasing importance and with extraordinary potential.
